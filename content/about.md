The LambdaStack Project is a collection of Microservices projects I primarily built in Rust for speed and safety. However, there are several other non-rust based projects that I have also included centered around automating and managing Ceph at work.

#### Projects
1. <a href="https://github.com/lambdastackio/aws-sdk-rust">aws-sdk-rust</a> - AWS S3 SDK for Rust. It's a very fast multi-threaded SDK to access AWS S3
2. <a href="https://github.com/lambdastackio/s3lsio">s3lsio</a> - S3LSIO is an AWS S3 CLI that is simple, fast and safe that can return data in JSON or be used in a script
3. <a href="https://github.com/klaus-rs">klaus</a> - Klaus is a true Hybrid WebStack. Meaning, it has S3, rate limiting and Redis integration built-in which allows it to be used as a multi-threaded async I/O futures based web server, an API server and an Agent Server. It's very flexible. It also has no dependencies so it works very well with Docker
4. <a href="https://github.com/ceph/ceph-rust">ceph-rust</a> - Ceph Librados and Admin Socket interface to Ceph in Rust. It's the Official Ceph interface for Rust
5. <a href="https://github.com/lambdastackio/tokio-http2">tokio-http2</a> - HTTP/2 futures based Rust library that is the heart of Klaus
6. cepheus - Cepheus is the Ceph and AWS Storage management platform. Klaus, aws-sdk-rust, ceph-rust and s3lsio are the heart of Cepheus
7. <a href="https://github.com/ceph/ceph-chef">ceph-chef</a> - The Official Chef Cookbook for Ceph where I maintain it at the Ceph Github repo
8. <a href="https://github.com/bloomberg/chef-bcs">chef-bcs</a> - The Official Chef repo for the Bloomberg Cloud Storage system that I created
