**NB: Disclaimer - This is not a review. Interesting drive for "deep and cheap" storage**

I have experience with many drive types. I have had some actually catch on fire in my data center before. When I see an interesting drive I will often review it or simply post about it for future reference for myself. In this case, a future possible reference for self-encrypting drives.
