#### Don't use Ceph with SMR Drives!

A while back at Ceph Day in NYC I saw a representative from a drive manufacturer talk about SMR drives. SMR stands for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shingled_magnetic_recording">`Shingled Magnetic Recording`</a> and the analogy given was 'think about the shingles on a house'. It sounded very interesting but they were not on the market at the time.

A very active community member, Wido den Hollander, posted his findings <a href="https://blog.widodh.nl/2017/02/do-not-use-smr-disks-with-ceph/">here</a>. The net result was `DO NOT USE SMR DRIVES!`
