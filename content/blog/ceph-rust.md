#### Offical Ceph Rust Librados Library

The official Ceph librados Rust API has been released called ceph-rust. Ceph-rust can be found at crates.io and at https://github.com/ceph/ceph-rust. Ceph-rust is a very thin layer above the C librados library that drives Ceph. In addition, it has some higher level APIs that wrap the low-level C interface with Rust specific protection. Working with Ceph is now fast and safe.
