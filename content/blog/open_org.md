#### Open Organizations
I have been asked recently a number of times about how best to bring teams together (not physically) and get buy-in on important projects especially when the org structure is more Matrix. Of course, there is no silver bullet to speak of in this case. Each organization has it's own political structure that may have to be navigated which is so unfortunate because most people are not comfortable with change.

Change should be **embraced and enjoyed** (assuming the change is in the right direction). There are several things that I feel an organization should look strongly at, Amazon's Leadership Principals and becoming an Open Organization.

I follow https://opensource.com about Open Organizations. <a href="https://opensource.com/open-organization/17/2/5-elements-teams-organized?sc_cid=7016000000122FhAAI">Here is a good article this week (click here).</a>
