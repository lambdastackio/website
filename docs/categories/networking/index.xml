      <description>Why do I get a TCP RST return when I try to PUT or GET S3 objects? I have a colleague that has made the following statement:
&amp;quot;The data is sacred but, the requests are not!&amp;quot;  This holds very true when dealing with HTTP calls such as S3 GETs and PUTs.
Recently, we noticed that a client was doing a massive amounts of PUTs and then issuing corresponding GETs on the same S3 objects.</description>

      <description>Load Balancers - HAProxy vs Other Load Balancers are very import tools for scalability, depending on the protocol. For HTTP(S), load balancers are a must unless you&amp;rsquo;re good with having only one web server exposed. Recently, I was asked to do performance tests of our HAProxy servers that front our Ceph RGW (S3) nodes and do the same for a very popular hardware load balancer.
The name of the hardware load balancer vendors will not be released to protect the innocent - ME :)</description>
