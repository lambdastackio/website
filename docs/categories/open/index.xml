      <description>Open Organizations I have been asked recently a number of times about how best to bring teams together (not physically) and get buy-in on important projects especially when the org structure is more Matrix.

Each organization has it&amp;rsquo;s own political structure that may have to be navigated which is so unfortunate because most people are not comfortable with change.</description>
