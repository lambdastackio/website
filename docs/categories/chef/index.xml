      <description>Ceph is a very complex distributed storage system that provides an Object Store, Block Storage Devices and Distributed File System. It has a built-in installation program called Ceph-Deploy but it&amp;rsquo;s design is for very simple and small installations. There are two official automated installation and maintenance systems for Ceph, Ceph-Ansible and Ceph-Chef. As the name implies, Ceph-Ansible is built for the Ansible while Ceph-Chef is built for Chef. I will focus on Ceph-Chef for the Chef environment.</description>

      <description>Talk at OpenStack Summit in Austin TX. I discussed our new Architecture for our Object Store. I also go into (just a little) why a fully hyper-converged Compute/Storage is not a good idea for large installations.</description>
