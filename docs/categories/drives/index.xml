      <description>Seagate 8TB ISE HDD NB: Disclaimer - This is not a review. Interesting drive for &amp;ldquo;deep and cheap&amp;rdquo; storage
I have experience with many drive types. I have had some actually catch on fire in my data center before. When I see an interesting drive I will often review it or simply post about it for future reference for myself. In this case, a future possible reference for self-encrypting drives.</description>

      <description>Don&amp;rsquo;t use Ceph with SMR Drives! A while back at Ceph Day in NYC I saw a representative from a drive manufacturer talk about SMR drives. SMR stands for Shingled Magnetic Recordingand the analogy given was &amp;lsquo;think about the shingles on a house&amp;rsquo;. It sounded very interesting but they were not on the market at the time.
A very active community member, Wido den Hollander, posted his findings here. The net result was DO NOT USE SMR DRIVES!</description>
