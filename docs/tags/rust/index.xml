      <description>Rust Programming A programming language from Heaven! Unlike the language of sorcerers, Ruby, Rust is a real language that gives you all of the speed and power benefits of C/C++, functional model of some scripting languages and true safety that only Rust can provide.
C/C++ and Python I cut my teeth on C and C++ many years ago. I actually won many awards for writing Best C/C++ Middleware from Database Advisor Magazine (dating myself).</description>

      <description>Offical Ceph Rust Librados Library The official Ceph librados Rust API has been released called ceph-rust. Ceph-rust can be found at crates.io and at https://github.com/ceph/ceph-rust. Ceph-rust is a very thin layer above the C librados library that drives Ceph. In addition, it has some higher level APIs that wrap the low-level C interface with Rust specific protection. Working with Ceph is now fast and safe.</description>
